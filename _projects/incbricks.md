## IncBricks
This project is motivated by the emergence of programmable network devices and the increasing data traffic of datacenters. Its key ideas are offloading a set of simple compute operations from end-servers onto programmable network devices so that (1) client requests can be served on the fly with low latency; (2) network traffic is reduced; (3) servers can run in a low-power mode. Towards this end, we built the IncBricks system. IncBricks is a hardware-software co-designed system that supports caching in the network using a programmable network middlebox. We use a small scale testbed demonstrating its performance benefits.
