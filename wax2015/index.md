---
Welcome to the 2015 Workshop on Approximate Computing Across the Stack (WAX)! WAX is a venue for research focusing on computing with unreliability and inexactness. WAX's first instance succeeded two previous workshops, [WACAS][] and [APPROX][], from 2014.

WAX was held on Saturday, June 13, 2015, [co-located][pldiwks] with [PLDI 2015][] as part of [FCRC][].
See the [program][], which has links to the papers and slides.
