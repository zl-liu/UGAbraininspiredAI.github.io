## WAX 2015 Workshop Program

### Saturday, June 13, 2015; OCC C120--C121

**9:30--10:00:** Opening and introductions

Be ready to say who you are, where you're affiliated with, and why you're at the workshop.

**10:00--11:00am:** Position paper talks, session 1: *Domains*

Talks are 10 minutes each, and each talk will have 3 minutes for short clarification questions immediately afterward.
The last 20 minutes are for discussion of all of the papers in the session: we'll spend 10 minutes in small-group discussion; the last 10 minutes are for discussion among the whole group and asking questions of the speakers.

  * [Statistical Information Processing: Extending the Limits of Approximate Computing](papers/malik.pdf)  
    Sharad Malik and Naveen Verma (Princeton University), Subhasish Mitra
    (Stanford University), and Naresh Shanbhag (University of Illinois, Urbana
    Champaign)
  * [Approximating Outside the Processor](papers/stanley-marbell.pdf)  
    Phillip Stanley-Marbell and Martin Rinard (MIT)  
    [talk slides](talks/stanley-marbell.pdf)
  * [Approximating with Input Level Granularity](papers/hill.pdf)  
    Parker Hill, Michael Laurenzano, Mehrzad Samadi, Scott Mahlke, Jason Mars,
    and Lingjia Tang (University of Michigan)  
    [talk slides](talks/hill.pdf)

**11:00--11:30am:** Break

**11:30--noon:** Lightning talks

Each speaker gets 60 seconds to present and 60 seconds for questions. We will use any time left over at the end for ad-hoc slide-free talks, large-group discussion, and more questions for the speakers.

**noon--12:30pm:** Organizing for lunchtime discussions

We'll select topics for discussion over lunch, assign groups to topics, and choose a scribe for each group. The scribe will be responsible for reporting out from the discussion after lunch.

**12:30--2:00pm:** Lunch

If you're a group's scribe, be sure to use the last few minutes of the lunch slot to prepare for reporting out---make your slides if you want to use any.

**2:00--2:30pm:** Summary discussion from lunch breakouts

Each group's scribe has a few minutes to talk and lead discussion on the results from the topic.

**2:30--3:30pm:** Position paper talks, session 2: *Quality*

10+3 minutes per talk; 10 minutes small-group discussion; 10 minutes large-group discussion.

  * [Towards Automated Differential Program Verification for Approximate Computing](papers/lahiri.pdf)  
    Shuvendu K. Lahiri (Microsoft Research) and Zvonimir Rakamari&cacute; (University
    of Utah)  
    [talk slides](talks/lahiri.pdf)
  * [ACOCO: Adaptive Coding for Approximate Computing on Faulty Memories](papers/huang.pdf)

  * [REACT: A Framework for Rapid Exploration of Approximate Computing Techniques](papers/wyse.pdf)  
    Mark Wyse, Andre Baixo, Thierry Moreau, Bill Zorn, James Bornholt, Adrian
    Sampson, Luis Ceze, and Mark Oskin (University of Washington)  
    [talk slides](talks/wyse.pdf)

**3:30--4:00pm:** Break

**4:00--5:00pm:** Position paper talks, session 3: *Efficiency*
