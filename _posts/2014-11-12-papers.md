Congratulations to Brandon Lucia on his CGO paper on data provenance in multithreaded programs (the last chapter of his thesis); to Thierry, Mark Wyse, Adrian and Jacob on their HPCA paper on FPGA-based neural acceleration; and to Mike Ringenburg and Adrian on their ASPLOS paper on debugging and monitoring quality in approximate programs! Great news!!
