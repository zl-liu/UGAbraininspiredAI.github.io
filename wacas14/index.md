Welcome to the first Workshop on Approximate Computing Across the System Stack
(WACAS)!

The workshop aims to explore new ideas in the realm of *approximate computing*,
a research direction that asks how computer systems can be made
better---faster, more efficient, and less complex---by relaxing the
requirement
that they be exactly correct. Approximate systems raise questions from across
the system stack, from circuits to applications. WACAS is a venue for
discussion, debate, and brainstorming on all of these topics.

WACAS 2014 was be held on March 2, 2014, co-located with [ASPLOS
2014][asplos].  See the [full program][program] for links to papers and slides.

(The archived [call for papers][cfp] is also available.)
